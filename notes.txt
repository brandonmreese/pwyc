Will need Square pos-api:

SQUARE Meeting
https://developer.squareup.com/forums/t/api-access-for-tickets/297/10

Orders which have been created.

Variable pricing at the item level, 

Split payments on orders. Experience 

POS add-ons -- exactly what we need -- realistic 6-12 months

Tickets API -- separate release, also similar timeline: 2022


TODO:
- hook up to POS
-- 
- input validation
-- for REST input
--- check that suggested total is less than some absurd total (i.e. $10,000)
-- for "pay less"
--- check minimum $3.00
--- check for less than suggested
-- for "pay more"
--- check for more than suggested
--- check for less than some absurd total (i.e. $10,000 but check with Maggie, this should be a business parameter)
- UI cleanup
-- buttons should fill whole button container box
- Logging
-- master logs stored on-device
-- rolling file appender (deletes old logs as needed)?
-- email capability?
-- database storage?


BUSINESS PARAMETERS:
- minimum "pay what you can" entry (i.e. $3.00)
- maximum "pay with token" per token (i.e. 1 token covers meal up to $15.00, etc)
- maximum in-app "pay more amount". i.e. do we want to process very large donations thru this channel or not?
- average cost of a meal (for use in the "donate 1 meal" or "donate 5 meals" quick totals)


Requirements needing clarification:
- do we need a database to keep track of payment selection history? volunteer contact information? is this out of scope? would a daily email be sufficient?


Within POS app:
SETUP: enable open tickets

EACH ORDER:
add items and click "Save" to create a ticket
