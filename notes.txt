Will need Square pos-api:

https://developer.squareup.com/docs/pos-api/how-it-works


BUSINESS PARAMETERS:
- minimum "pay what you can" entry (i.e. $3.00)
- maximum "pay with token" per token (i.e. 1 token covers meal up to $15.00, etc)
- maximum in-app "pay more amount". i.e. do we want to process very large donations thru this channel or not?


Within POS app:
SETUP: enable open tickets

EACH ORDER:
add items and click "Save" to create a ticket


Extra dev steps:
npm install -g expo-cli
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
expo install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
